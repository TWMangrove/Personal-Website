    <h1>My Journey to Building a Personal Website</h1>
    <h2>Limited HTML and CSS Knowledge</h2>
    <p>
      My journey to building a personal website started when I enrolled in a Programming Studio course at Texas A&M University. As a part of the course, I was asked to create a personal website, but I had very limited knowledge in HTML and CSS.
    </p>
    <h2>Youtube Tutorials and W3Schools</h2>
    <p>
      To overcome my lack of knowledge, I watched several Youtube tutorials and found one in particular that helped me a lot: "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&">HTML & CSS Full Course - Beginner to Pro</a>". I also went over the W3Schools course to develop my HTML and CSS skills over a short amount of time.
    </p>
    <h2>Continuing to Improve</h2>
    <p>
      Although I have come a long way in a short amount of time, I plan to continue improving my web design skills. I believe that the more I practice, the better I will become.
    </p>
    <h2>The Future of Web Design</h2>
    <p>
      I believe that AI will greatly facilitate several aspects of web design that I initially struggled with. For example, using AI-powered tools like ChatGPT, I can generate HTML and CSS code much faster and more efficiently.
