    <div class="interest-description"> 
      As can be seen in the previous section, my degree in Computer Engineering has afforded me experience with a diverse range of subjects within my area of study. 
      In turn, I have been able to develop a firm understanding of my strengths and weaknesses in the aforementioned subjects, and—more significantly—I have gained a 
      deep fervor for several of these areas. Broadly, my technical interests tend to lie more in the software end, rather than in hardware; hence, my current plan 
      is to graduate with a technical specialization in software systems. The College of Engineering at A&M allows for CE majors to take various high-level computer 
      science and electrical engineering courses as electives that work towards a declared area of specialization. As part of this program, I have completed Linear 
      Control Systems, an embedded systems course I pursued after excelling in the prerequisite Signal and Systems. During my final year of studies, I anticipate 
      enrollment in the following elective courses: Operating Systems, Design/Analysis of Algorithms, Computer-Human Interaction,  and Cryptography; all of which serve as credit 
      towards my Software Systems specialization. At the most fundamental level, my interest in software systems are largely in computer-human interfacing and data 
      science; subjects that I plan to explore both in and out of the classroom during my final year of college. I am drawn to these areas because I enjoy the notion 
      of developing creative solutions to problems when presented with far-reaching information and comprehensive variables.
